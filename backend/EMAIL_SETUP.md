# Email Service Setup Guide

## Overview
The application supports two email providers:
1. **SendGrid API** (Recommended for production - more reliable on cloud platforms)
2. **SMTP/Gmail** (For development or if you prefer traditional SMTP)

The system automatically selects SendGrid if `SENDGRID_API_KEY` is configured, otherwise falls back to SMTP.

## Option 1: SendGrid Setup (Recommended for Render/Cloud)

### Why SendGrid?

- ‚úÖ Better tracking and analytics

### Setup Steps:

#### 1. Create SendGrid Account
1. Go to [https://sendgrid.com](https://sendgrid.com)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Verify your email address

#### 2. Create API Key
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí API Keys
2. Click "Create API Key"
3. Name it: `claim-app-production`

  FRONTEND_URL=https://claim-settle-management-gyjm.vercel.app
  ```

**In local `config.env`:**
```env
# SendGrid Configuration (Recommended for Production)
SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
EMAIL_FROM=info@theyellownetwork.com

# Frontend URL
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

#### 5. Deploy

## Option 2: SMTP/Gmail Setup (Development Only)

### Setup Steps:

#### 1. Enable 2-Factor Authentication on Gmail
1. Go to your Google Account settings
2. Enable 2-Factor Authentication

#### 2. Generate App Password
1. Go to Google Account ‚Üí Security ‚Üí 2-Step Verification ‚Üí App passwords
2. Select "Mail" and "Other (Custom name)"
3. Name it: "Claim App"
4. Copy the 16-character password (format: xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx)

#### 3. Configure Environment Variables

**In `config.env`:**
```env
# SMTP Configuration (Development or if SendGrid not available)
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=465
SMTP_USER=innovation@theyellow.network
SMTP_PASS=xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx
SMTP_FROM=info@theyellownetwork.com

# Frontend URL
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** SMTP (especially port 587 and 465) is often blocked on cloud platforms like Render, AWS, Azure. Use SendGrid for production.

## Testing

### Local Testing:
```bash

```

### Test Forgot Password Flow:
1. Go to `http://localhost:3000/login`
2. Click "Forgot your password?"
3. Enter a registered email
4. Check email inbox (and spam folder)
5. Click the reset link
6. Enter new password
7. Log in with new password

## Troubleshooting

### SendGrid Issues:

**"Sender email not verified"**
- Go to SendGrid ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Sender Authentication
- Verify your sender email address
- Wait for verification email and click the link

**"API key invalid"**
- Regenerate API key in SendGrid dashboard
- Make sure you copied it correctly (starts with `SG.`)
- Update environment variable and redeploy

**"Email not arriving"**
- Check spam folder
- Verify sender email is verified in SendGrid
- Check SendGrid ‚Üí Activity Feed for delivery status

### SMTP Issues:

**"Connection timeout"**
- Port 587/465 is blocked by your cloud provider
- Switch to SendGrid instead
- Or contact your cloud provider to whitelist SMTP ports

**"Invalid credentials"**
- Regenerate app password in Google Account
- Make sure 2FA is enabled
- Copy password without spaces

**"Authentication failed"**
- Double-check SMTP_USER and SMTP_PASS
- Use app password, not regular Gmail password
