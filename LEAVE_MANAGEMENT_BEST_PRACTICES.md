## Best Practices Implemented

### 1. User Experience (UX)
- **Consistent Navigation**: Unified tab-based navigation across dashboards
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layouts with proper grid systems
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators for all async operations
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages

### 2. Data Management
- **Efficient API Calls**: Strategic use of React Query for caching and synchronization
- **Real-time Updates**: Automatic data refresh after CRUD operations
- **Filtering Performance**: Client-side filtering for better performance
- **Data Validation**: Proper validation before API calls

### 3. Security & Access Control
- **Role-based Access**: Strict role-based component rendering
- **Email-based Authorization**: Specific email validation for executive access
- **Protected Routes**: AuthWrapper implementation for secure access
- **Data Isolation**: Users can only access their own data (employees)

### 4. Code Organization
- **Component Separation**: Logical separation of concerns
- **Reusable Components**: Shared components for common functionality
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript implementation for better code quality
- **Consistent Styling**: Tailwind CSS for consistent design system

### 5. Performance Optimization
- **Lazy Loading**: Components loaded only when needed
- **Memoization**: Proper use of useMemo for expensive calculations
- **Efficient Rendering**: Optimized re-rendering with proper dependency arrays
- **Data Caching**: Strategic caching of frequently accessed data

## Leave Types & Color Coding

### Standard Leave Types:
1. **Planned Leave** - Green (`bg-green-100 text-green-800`)
2. **Unplanned Leave** - Red (`bg-red-100 text-red-800`)
3. **WFH (Work From Home)** - Blue (`bg-blue-100 text-blue-800`)
4. **Permission** - Yellow (`bg-yellow-100 text-yellow-800`)
5. **Business Trip** - Purple (`bg-purple-100 text-purple-800`)
6. **OD (Official Duty)** - Indigo (`bg-indigo-100 text-indigo-800`)
7. **Flexi** - Pink (`bg-pink-100 text-pink-800`)

### Leave Status Types:
1. **Submitted** - Yellow (`bg-yellow-100 text-yellow-800`)
2. **Approved** - Green (`bg-green-100 text-green-800`)
3. **Rejected** - Red (`bg-red-100 text-red-800`)

## API Integration

### Key API Endpoints Used:
- `useGetLeavesQuery`: Fetch leaves with year/month filtering
